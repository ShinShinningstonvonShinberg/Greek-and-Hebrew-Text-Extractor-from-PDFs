# Greek-and-Hebrew-Text-Extractor-from-PDFs
Program that lets you extract Greek or Hebrew Text from one or multiple PDFs. It outputs the extracted text as a simple ".txt" cosponsoring to the original PDF. 
Very bear-bones right now, but it does what I need it to do, and I made this because I couldn't find something like it online. Hopefully you find use for it too, even though it's not exactly fleshed out. I don't really care what you do with this thing, just don't sell it for money. Not because you'd be stealing, but because it's a grave sin to make merchandise out of God. Jesus drove the money-changers out of the temple with a whip, and Peter warns (in Second Peter) that there's a special punishment for those who do such a thing. Though being honest, if you don't beleive in Jesus, then you've got far bigger problems than that.
To run the program, simply drop "GreekHebrewTextExtractor.exe" into the folder where those PDFs are stored, and run it. It'll work from there, you'll see.
At some point, I'd like to add a macOS and Linux version. What that entails is that I stop eating pizza, icecream, mac and cheese, and french fries for long enough to do so. That is an uphill battle.
